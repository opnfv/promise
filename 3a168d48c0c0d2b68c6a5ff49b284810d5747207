Also, from the allocation flow, seems the capacity databases are updated directly when an allocation request is received in the Shim layer.\n\nIn the figure this step is shown as 5, should be changed to 4",

      "message": "The capacity manager does not need to know about the reservations. The reservation manager on the other hand needs to check the available capacities when it receives a reservation request. For simplification, I will replace \"Capacity/Reservation/Allocation Manager\" with \"shim-layer\", as anyhow this is not distinguished in the current implementation.\n\nThe Figure will be corrected.",
