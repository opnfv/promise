Important notes
===============

**Attention:** Please be aware that the Promise shim-layer implementation is marked as DEPREACTED
in Euphrates and both implementation and related test cases may be removed from next release.

Abstract
===============

This document provides an overview of the Promise project in the OPNFV Euphrates
release. Promise is a resource reservation and management project to identify NFV related
requirements and realize resource reservation for future usage by capacity
management of resource pools regarding compute, network and storage.


Features
============

The following features are provided by the Promise in the OPNFV Euphrates release:

* Capacity Management
* Reservation Management
* Allocation Management

The Euphrates implementation of Promise is built with the YangForge data modeling
framework [#f2]_ , using a shim-layer on top of OpenStack to provide
the Promise features.

In the OPNFV Euphrates release cycle most efforts have been spent to progress the upstream
implementation of a native resource reservation system for OpenStack as part of the Blazar project
[#f3]_.

Detailed information about Promise use cases, features, interface
specifications, work flows, and the underlying Promise YANG schema can be found
in the Promise requirement document [#f1]_ .

Thereby, the following test cases (`TEST_CASES`_) are executed:

 - Add a new OpenStack provider to the reservation service
 - Allocation of resources without prior reservation
 - Reservation of a VM for immediate use followed by allocation
 - Reservation of a VM for future use
 - Update reservation
 - Query reservation
 - Cancel reservation
 - Error case: try to create reservation with a conflict
 - Capacity management - increase/decrease available capacity of a provider
 - Capacity Management - query for available and used capacity
