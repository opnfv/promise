Summary and conclusion
======================

Resource Reservation and Resource Capacity Management are features to be
supported by the VIM and exposed to the consumer via the VIM NBI. These
features have been specified by ETSI NFV.

This document has described several use cases and corresponding high level
flows where Resource Reservation and Capacity Management are of great benefit
for the consumer of the virtualised resource management interface: the NFVO or
the VNFM. The use cases include:

* Notification of changes in capacity in the NFVI
* Query of available resource capacity
* Reservation of a resource or set of resources for immediate use
* Reservation of a resource or set of resources for future use

The Promise project has performed a gap analysis in order to fulfil the
required functionality. Based on the gap analysis an implementation plan and
way forward has been proposed, including a possible design architecture and
high level information model. Immediate next steps of this project is to
deliver a working Proof-of-Concepts (PoC) and engage upstream communities to
fill out the gaps identified by Promise.
